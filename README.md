# HomewardBounds
Homeward Bounds is an application created by Ross Usinger, Giles Holmes, and David Vehapetian for their senior year project at Wentworth Insitute of Technology. The aim is to use one Raspberry Pi to track another Raspberry Pi in a given household, and eventually to create a product that will allow dog owners to keep their dogs out of rooms they want to stay dog-free.

Required hardware:
- Two raspberry pis, preferably full-on pis, and not zeros.
- either a portable battery or very long power cable for one of the pis
- a place to affix one of the pis as a "hub"

To run:

- place the "hub" pi in the room where it can stay; a room on one side of a house or building (providing it is not too large) is the best for training purposes.

- begin the trainingServer.py python script on
